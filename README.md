# Blackjack - 21

## Description
Blackjack is a card game that is played against a dealer. The goal of the game is to get a hand that is worth more than the dealer's hand, but not over 21. Blackjack is believed to have originated in France in the 17th century. The game was then brought to the United States, where it quickly became popular.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It is a relatively simple game to learn, but it can be challenging to master. Blackjack is also a game of chance, so there is always the possibility of losing money. However, for many people, the thrill of the game is worth the risk.
